# Coding Style

## General Rules:

* We use four spaces for indentation \(not tabs\).
* Do not use Hungarian Notation!
* Avoid more than one empty line at any time. For example, do not have two blank lines between members of a type.
* If a file happens to differ in style from these guidelines \(e.g. private members are named m\_member rather than \_member\), the existing style in that file takes precedence.
* We only use `var` when it's obvious what the variable type is \(e.g. `var stream = new FileStream(...)` not `var stream = OpenStandardInput()`\).
* Fields should be specified at the top within type declarations.
* When using a single-statement `if`, we follow these conventions:
  * Using braces is always accepted, and required if any block of an if/else if/.../else compound statement uses braces or if a single statement body spans multiple lines.
  * Braces may be omitted only if the body of every block associated with an if/else if/.../else compound statement is placed on a single line. 
* Avoid complex conditions in ternary operators.
* Avoid declaring methods with more than 5 parameters. Consider refactoring this code.
* Try to replace large parameter-sets \(&gt; than 5 parameters\) with one or more `class` or `struct` parameters –

  especially when used in multiple method signatures. 

* Always call `Close()` or `Dispose()` on classes that offer it. 
* Wrap instantiation of `IDisposable` objects with a “`using`” statement to ensure that Dispose\(\) is

  automatically called.

* Always prefer aggregation over inheritance. 

## Naming:

* We use `camelCase` for local variables and parameters.
* We use `_camelCase` for internal and private fields and use readonly where possible. Prefix internal and private instance fields with `_`, and thread static fields with `t_`.
* We use `snake_case` for test method names.
* We use `IPascalCase` for interfaces names \(see the `I` prefix\).
* For the rest of identifiers not specified here, we use `PascalCase`.
