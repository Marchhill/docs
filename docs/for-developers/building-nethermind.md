# Building from source

The Nethermind's source code can be obtained from [our repository](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind) on GitHub:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/nethermindeth/nethermind.git
```

There are two options buiding Nethermind from source code:

* [Standalone binaries](building-nethermind.md#building-standalone-binaries)
* [Docker image](building-nethermind.md#bulding-docker-image)

## Building standalone binaries

### Prerequisites

To build Nethermind from source, install [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) 7 or later.

### Building

To build both the client and tests, run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
dotnet build src/Nethermind/Nethermind.sln -c release
```

To simply run the client with a specific configuration without building tests, see below.

<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/for-developers/building-nethermind.md
:::info
Before running the client or tests, ensure the platform-specific [prerequisites](../ethereum-client/running-nethermind/running-the-client.md#prerequisites) are met.

#### Running the client

To launch the client, run the following command from the project's root directory (the previous step of the build is not required):

```bash
cd src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Runner
dotnet run -c release -- -c mainnet
```

All Nethermind-specific parameters can be specified after `--`. For instance, the command above specifies the Mainnet configuration only.

The build artifacts can be found in the `bin/release/net7.0` directory. By default, the logs and database directories are located here as well.

For more info, see [Running Nethermind](../ethereum-client/running-nethermind/running-the-client.md).

#### Testing

There are two test suites â€” Nethermind and Ethereum Foundation. Tests can be run with the following commands (the initial step of the build is not required):

```bash
cd src/Nethermind

# Run Nethermind tests
dotnet test Nethermind.sln -c release

# Run Ethereum Foundation tests
dotnet test EthereumTests.sln -c release
```

## Bulding Docker image

To build Nethermind Docker image, run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
docker build -t nethermind .
```
