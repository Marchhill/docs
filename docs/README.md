# Welcome to Nethermind

Welcome to the Nethermind Client documentation! Nethermind is a leading provider of Ethereum solutions for developers
and enterprises. Founded in 2017 by a small team of world-class technologists, Nethermind has worked tirelessly to
deliver the fastest Ethereum client in the market. Boosted by a grant from the Ethereum Foundation in August 2018, our
team has built a flagship Ethereum client that is all about performance and flexibility.

The Nethermind Client is built on .NET core, a widespread, enterprise-friendly platform that makes integration with
existing infrastructures simple. At the same time, the Nethermind Client does not compromise on stability, reliability,
data integrity, and security. Whether you're a developer looking to build decentralized applications on the Ethereum
network, an enterprise looking for a reliable Ethereum solution, or a user looking to interact with the Ethereum
blockchain, the Nethermind Client has you covered.

In this documentation, you'll find information on how to install and configure the Nethermind Client, as well as how to
use its various features. We've organized the documentation by topic to make it easy for you to find the information you
need, and we've included plenty of examples and visuals to help you understand how to use the Nethermind Client.

We hope you find this documentation helpful, and we welcome your feedback and suggestions for how we can continue to
improve the Nethermind Client and its documentation.
